# GASS - Github Activity Scoring System

A proof of concept designed to improve the airdrop claim experience by connecting GitHub contributions to token distribution. GASS provides a fair, transparent, and verifiable system for rewarding developers based on their actual contributions.

## Problem Statement

Traditional airdrops lack transparency, are vulnerable to Sybil attacks, and don't reward actual contributions. GASS solves these issues by connecting GitHub activity metrics to token distribution through a three-part system.

## System Components

GASS connects three key components to create a fair and transparent token distribution system:

1. **GitHub Action with OpenRouter**: Analyzes code reviews and pushes metrics to the O2 Oracle for tracking developers' projects and contributions.
   - [GitHub Action Workflow](/.github/workflows/push_quality_score.yml) and [Scripts](/.github/scripts/)
   - Deployed at `0x5441D1C780E82959d48dcE6af9E36Dbe8f1992B2` on Base Sepolia
   - Tracks quality scores, activity timestamps, and contribution volume
   - Automatically runs on pull request events (open, sync, reopen)

2. **Smart Contract with Forte Rules Engine**: Applies token allocation policies based on the metrics from the O2 Oracle.
   - [Smart Contracts](/src/) and [Deployment Scripts](/script/)
   - [Distribution Policy](/o2_oracle_policy.json)
   - Deployed at `0x171A95CE45025f0AE0e56eC67Bf7084117e335d8` on Base Sepolia
   - Uses policy rules to determine appropriate token distribution tiers

3. **Web App with Dynamic Authentication**: Verifies that users claiming rewards are the authorized GitHub users, with built-in wallet functionality.
   - [Web Wallet Demo](/web-wallet-demo/)
   - Provides seamless GitHub verification and wallet integration
   - Ensures only legitimate GitHub users can claim their tokens

## How It Works

1. **GitHub Activity Analysis**: The GitHub Action uses OpenRouter to analyze code reviews and contributions, then pushes metrics to the O2 Oracle:
   - Triggered automatically on pull requests
   - Uses Claude 3 Opus via OpenRouter API to perform code quality analysis
   - Calculates a quality score (0-100) based on code review
   - Tracks metrics like last activity timestamp and contribution count
   - Stores all data in the O2 Oracle for on-chain access

2. **Token Distribution Rules**: The Forte Rules Engine applies the following distribution tiers based on developer metrics:
   - **Rejected**: Quality score â‰¤ 50 (transaction reverts)
   - **Limited**: Quality score > 50, but activity not recent (half tokens)
   - **Bonus**: Quality score > 50, recent activity, high contribution volume (double tokens)
   - **Standard**: Quality score > 50, recent activity, normal contribution volume (standard amount)

3. **Verified Claims**: The web app uses Dynamic to verify GitHub identity and provide wallet functionality:
   - Users authenticate with GitHub through Dynamic
   - The app verifies the user is the legitimate GitHub account owner
   - Users can check their rewards eligibility with visual indicators for each tier
   - The interface displays detailed contract call information including quality score, last contribution date, and review count
   - Users can claim tokens directly through the integrated wallet with a single click

## Key Benefits

1. **Meritocratic Distribution**: Tokens are allocated based on actual contributions
2. **Sybil Resistance**: Distribution requires verified GitHub accounts and real activity
3. **Transparent Rules**: All distribution criteria are publicly visible on-chain
4. **Flexible Policies**: Distribution rules can be updated without changing contract code
5. **Seamless Experience**: Integrated verification and wallet functionality

## Technical Implementation

### GitHub Action

The GitHub Action workflow (`push_quality_score.yml`) runs automatically on pull request events:

1. **Code Analysis Process**:
   - Extracts the PR diff for analysis
   - Sends the diff to OpenRouter with a comprehensive code review prompt
   - Uses Claude 3 Opus to evaluate code quality, readability, potential issues, documentation, and best practices
   - Extracts a numerical score (0-100) from the AI's assessment

2. **O2 Oracle Integration**:
   - Authenticates with the O2 Oracle API
   - Checks if the GitHub user already exists in the database
   - For existing users: calculates a weighted average score based on previous contributions
   - For new users: creates a new entry with the initial score
   - Updates metrics including quality score, last activity timestamp, and contribution count
   - Publishes changes to make them available on-chain

### Smart Contract

The GASS contract is deployed at `0x171A95CE45025f0AE0e56eC67Bf7084117e335d8` on Base Sepolia with Policy ID `69`. It uses the Forte Rules Engine to apply distribution rules based on O2 Oracle data.

### O2 Oracle

The O2 Oracle at `0x5441D1C780E82959d48dcE6af9E36Dbe8f1992B2` stores developer metrics:
- Quality scores (code quality assessment)
- Last updated timestamps (recency of activity)
- Review counts (contribution volume)

### Web App with Dynamic

The web app uses Dynamic for GitHub authentication and wallet functionality:
- Verifies GitHub identity through OAuth
- Provides embedded wallet functionality
- Connects to Base Sepolia network
- Interacts with the GASS contract for token claims
- Features a clean UI with dark/light mode toggle
- Shows visual indicators for reward tier eligibility
- Displays detailed contract call information

## GitHub Verification

We've implemented two approaches for GitHub verification:

1. **JWT-Based Verification** (Recommended): Uses Dynamic's JWT verification system
   - User authenticates with GitHub through Dynamic
   - Backend verifies JWT token with Dynamic's API
   - Contract accepts verification from trusted backend

2. **Signature-Based Verification**: Uses on-chain signature verification
   - User signs a message containing GitHub username and wallet address
   - Contract verifies the signature matches the claiming wallet

## Sample Data

The O2 Oracle contains the following developer metrics:

| GitHub Username | Quality Score | Last Updated | Review Count | Expected Distribution Tier |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------|-------------|---------------------------|
| benichmt1       | 63           | 1747331744   | 25          | Limited (50% allocation) |

## Use Cases

This proof of concept can be extended for:
- Token airdrops based on community contributions
- Retroactive funding for open source developers
- DAO governance token distribution
- Community rewards programs
- Contributor reputation systems

## Web App Interface

The GASS web application provides a clean, intuitive interface for users to connect their GitHub accounts and check their rewards eligibility. The UI features a modern design with both dark and light mode options, debug and simulation mode toggles, and clear visual indicators for verification status.

![GASS Web App Interface - Main Screen](images/gass-main-screen.png)

After connecting, users can see their eligibility for different reward tiers based on their GitHub activity metrics. Each tier displays a green checkmark for eligible tiers or a red X for ineligible tiers, along with the specific criteria for each tier. The interface also shows detailed contract call information including quality score, last contribution date, and review count.
